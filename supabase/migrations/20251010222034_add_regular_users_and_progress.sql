  # Add Regular Users and Reading Progress Tracking
  
  ## Overview
  Adds support for regular (non-admin) users who can register and track their reading progress.
  
  ## New Tables
  
  ### 1. `user_profiles`
  Stores information about regular users
  - `id` (uuid, primary key, references auth.users) - User ID
  - `full_name` (text) - User's full name
  - `created_at` (timestamptz) - Profile creation timestamp
  
  ### 2. `reading_progress`
  Tracks which articles users have read
  - `id` (uuid, primary key) - Unique identifier
  - `user_id` (uuid) - References user_profiles
  - `article_id` (uuid) - References articles
  - `completed` (boolean) - Whether article was fully read
  - `completed_at` (timestamptz) - When the article was completed
  - `created_at` (timestamptz) - When user started reading
  - Unique constraint on (user_id, article_id)
  
  ## Security
  
  ### Row Level Security
  
  #### user_profiles
  - Users can read and update their own profile
  - Users can create their own profile during registration
  - Admins can view all user profiles
  
  #### reading_progress
  - Users can only see and manage their own reading progress
  - Users can insert and update their own progress
  - Admins cannot see user progress (privacy)
  
  ## Indexes
  - Added index on user_id for fast progress lookups
  - Added index on article_id for analytics
